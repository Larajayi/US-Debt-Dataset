**
Questions & Answers**
1. What was the Yearly Debt Percentage Increase for each year compared to the previous year?
From 2016 to 2019, the average yearly increase in total public debt was approximately 5% per year.

In 2020, there was a significant spike in debt growth, largely due to pandemic-related government responses.

2. Which months historically have seen the highest/lowest increases in Total Debt?
Highest increases: January, February, November, and December.

Lowest increases: April, May, June, and July.

Hypothesis: The highest months coincide with major US holidays (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year) where increased consumer spending and gift buying drive higher debt levels. The lower months have fewer holidays and thus less debt accumulation.

3. What is the projected growth of publicly held debt in the next few years?
1997–2007: Publicly held debt increased by about $1 trillion.

2008–2019: Increased from approximately $6 trillion to $17 trillion.

2020–2022: Jumped from $21.5 trillion to $25 trillion.

2023–2027 (projection): Expected to rise steadily to around $33 trillion.

Conclusion: Publicly held debt is projected to grow at a steady rate over the next five years.
